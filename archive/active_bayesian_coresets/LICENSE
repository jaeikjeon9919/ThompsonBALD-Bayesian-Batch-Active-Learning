# Bayesian Batch Active Learning as Sparse Subset Approximation

###Academic and Non-Commercial Research Use Software License and Terms of Use

Bayesian Batch Active Learning as Sparse Subset Approximation is a software
package to perform Bayesian batch active learning according to specific
algorithms (the “Software”).  The Software is designed to automatically run
active learning experiments in a manner that iteratively selects batches of
query points to be labelled in such a way that learning is achieved in as
few queries as possible.

The Software was developed by Robert Pinsler, Jonathan Gordon, Eric Nalisnick,
and Jose Miguel Hernandez-Lobato at the University of Cambridge. Pursuant to an
inter-institutional agreement between the parties it is distributed for free
academic and non-commercial research use by the Chancellor, Masters and Scholars
of the University of Cambridge ("Cambridge") and Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd ("Samsung").

Using the Software indicates your agreement to be bound by the terms
of this Software Use Agreement (“Agreement”). Absent your agreement
to the terms below, you (the “End User”) have no rights to hold or
use the Software whatsoever.

Cambridge and Samsung agree to grant hereunder the limited
non-exclusive license to End User for the use of the Software in the
performance of End User’s internal, non-commercial research and academic
use at End User’s academic or not-for-profit research institution
(“Institution”) on the following terms and conditions:

**1.  NO REDISTRIBUTION.** The Software remains the property of Cambridge and
Samsung, and except as set forth in Section 4, End User
shall not publish, distribute, or otherwise transfer or make

**2.  NO COMMERCIAL USE.** End User shall not use the Software for
commercial purposes and any such use of the Software is expressly
prohibited. This includes, but is not limited to, use of the
Software in fee-for-service arrangements, core facilities or
laboratories or to provide research services to (or in collaboration
with) third parties for a fee, and in industry-sponsored
collaborative research projects where any commercial rights are
granted to the sponsor. If End User wishes to use the Software for
commercial purposes or for any other restricted purpose, End User
must execute a separate license agreement with Samsung.

**3.  OWNERSHIP AND COPYRIGHT NOTICE.** Cambridge and Samsung own
all intellectual property in the Software. End User shall gain no

**4.  DERIVATIVE WORKS.** End User may create and use Derivative Works,
as such term is defined under U.S. copyright laws, provided that any
such Derivative Works shall be restricted to non-commercial,
internal research and academic use at End User’s Institution. End
User may distribute Derivative Works to other Institutions solely
for the performance of non-commercial, internal research and
academic use on terms substantially similar to this License and
Terms of Use.

**5.  PUBLICATION & ATTRIBUTION.** End User has the right to publish,
present, or share results from the use of the Software.  In
accordance with customary academic practice, End User will
acknowledge Cambridge and Samsung as the providers
of the Software and may cite the relevant reference(s) from the
following list of publications:
